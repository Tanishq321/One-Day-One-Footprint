# One-Day-One-Footprint
One Day, One Footprint is a modern, offline iOS app that helps users reflect on the environmental impact of everyday choices. Using SwiftUI, Canvas, motion, and context-aware design, it visualizes sustainability through calm interactions instead of numbers, data, or tracking.
